**Project Info**    Individual project

**Duration**    11/2018 - 12/2018

## Challenge

I believe that everyone has experienced such a moment in the restaurant, you felt hesitated about what to eat for dinner and you were unable to make a decision. There were so many options with dazzling names which made you confused. And you were worried about that the foods were far more different from what you expected. You originally wanted to try some fresh dishes, but because of those concerns, you once again chose to order the same dishes you ate last time.  Ordering foods is supposed to be a happy moment, but now it becomes a awkward one.

**How can we make the ordering process quick, easy, intuitive and happy?**

## Design Outcome

## Understand User Need

### Contextual Observation

In order to well understand the process of people ordering foods and what factors influence people’s ordering decision making under different ordering methods, I went to different restaurants and experienced different types of ordering methods. Meanwhile, I observed the ordering process of my friends and other customers to find the potential service problems.  

### Interview

To quickly narrow down the problem space and specify customers’ main pain points in the ordering process, I interviewed three people to know what inconvenience and problems they had. While preparing the questions, I kept the questions open enough and make sure every interviewee could talk about their experience in detail. Then I analyzed the collected data from the interview by making affinity map. I found that people’s problem including three main aspects: missing information, efficiency and ordering decision making

### Persona

I quickly responded from the interview and developed following four personas

### Journey Map

Then I draw a customer journey map to visualize the positive emotions and negative emotions are during ordering process. The user goals, their behaviors and pain points were all displayed. It helped to tell what and where the problems were and where I could improve by my design.

### Insight

Based on all preliminary research I have done, I gained following insights specifically.

## Design Process

### Design Decisions

Based on above insights I got, I made following decisions about my design.

### Brainstorm

Then I began to brainstorm possible ideas. I thought about three types of  concepts and listed them together.

After comparing all ideas above, I finally decided to create an App that could be easily accessed by people’s mobile devices and help them order easily and efficiently. Then I draw a storyboard to show my concept and the scenario.

### Storyboard

By creating a storyboard, it became much more easier for my users to understand what they could do under different scenarios. It also helped me make the logic of function clearer.

### Wireframe

Then I created paper prototypes to realize the process of ordering and make it simple, quick and intuitive.

### User flow & High-fidelity

## Reflection

I learn a lot from this design process and during my research process, I feel the importance of understanding user again. I r**espect their voice and learn from their behaviors.** And through talking with them I saw what really matter in the ordering process. 

Meanwhile, I tried to apply material design rules in this design. It really helps me **think about how the visual layout influence the efficiency of content delivery.**

Finally, the most meaningful thing I learn from this design process is to **keep a firm attitude** when there are lots of design aspects. **Don’t waste time on making design decision.** A designer should start from some place quickly and make something to get feedback, then polish your work based on that.
