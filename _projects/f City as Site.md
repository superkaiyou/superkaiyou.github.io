**Duration:**    11/20/2019 - 12/5/2019

### Project brief

The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), located at New York City, has served as a place to discover, interpret and disseminate, through scientific research and education, knowledge about human cultures, the natural world and the universe since it was funded at 1869.  Nowadays, the AMNH has tried much effort to transform their over 34 millions collections into digital form recently in order to share meaningful information for academic use. However, the digitalized transformation of collections for ordinary people to interact with in the museum is still waiting for incubation. With the digitalized transforming of people’s life, people has been used to merge their lifestyle with digital technology. There is a need from visitors to deeply interact with museum through the new media technology. The goal of this project is to create the “beyond the museum” experience by making the digital collections in a new instinctive and interactive way to generate digitalizing impact among the visitors outside the museum.

### Problem Statement
>##### How might we encourage visitors to explore the collections and build deeper connection with AMNH?

### Understand

#### Observation

When I visited the AMNH, I found that lots of people came to the museum to see these fantastic collections and exhibitions, but very few of them will stay in front of collections window to read the information board. Most of them just glanced at the collections and then kept going. Also I noticed that almost every kid tries to read the information board but unfortunately it’s hard for them to recognize those words and when their parents try to explain more to these kids, they can’t describe it clearly and lively with an inanimate board. The collections are awesome but became hard to let people know deeply about them. Or say it’s hard for people to build a deep connection with AMNH. So it really touches me and make me decided to focus on the general experience of visiting a museum.

#### Online Survey
From the online survey, I get a basic picture of the visitor coming to AMNH. Most of them come to AMNH for sightseeing and having fun with their friends and family, and few of them come to learn from the collections. Most of them are attracted by the collections, but none of them is interested in the education program. Over one quarter of them didn’t satisfy about their experience at AMNH. And the most interested part of the survey is that almost everyone feel it’s helpful for them to know the knowledge about the human cultures, the natural world and the universe, which is not  consistent with my observation that most of people just glanced at the collections.

#### Stakeholder Map
Then I made a stakeholder map to show the relationship between people and AMNH in order to help me keep listening the right voice during my design process

#### Secondary Research
I also conduct a secondary research to learn about the AMNH and the museum experience in a broader context. The American Museum of Natural History, located at New York City, is the largest natural history museum in the world. It has served as a place to discover, interpret and disseminate, through scientific research and education, knowledge about human cultures, the natural world and the universe, since it was found in 1869. Now, it has over 34 million pieces of collections and it offers permanent exhibitions including Biodiversity and Environmental Halls, Birds and Reptiles and Amphibians Halls, Earth and Planetary Sciences Halls, Fossil Halls, Grand Gallery, Human Origins and Cultural Halls, Mammal Halls, Rose Center for Earth and Space and temporary special exhibitions for annually over 5 million visitors and educators to study the natural history and explore the biological mechanism. However, only about 3 percent of museum’s millions of specimens and cultural artifacts are on public display. Also, in order to improve visitors’ experience at AMNH, The AMNH made Explorer, a digital information platform with a map, for visitor to better prepare their visit.

The AMNH has it own research team who has over 400 publications in the biological and historical fields every year, which has a huge academic impact. And it offers different kinds of education program to people of different ages from kids to adults, which make another huge contribution into the field of education.  Meanwhile, it holds expeditions at over 33 countries every year, which share the collections and scientific knowledge in a wide range.

Next digital technology by employing modern methods based on interaction design, interactive and artificial intelligence is a new direction for design museum experience. Museums are increasingly being transformed into hybrid spaces where virtual information coexists with tangible artifacts. The digital technology play a new role to enhance It does not only convey stories hidden inside the artifacts but also creating the new way through the interactive museum experience that continues people’s experience after the museum visit ends by social sharing.The AMNH has tried much effort to transform their collections into digital form recently in order to share crucial information for academic use. However, there is still a huge possibility to make the digital collections in a more instinctive way to generate digitalizing impact among the visitors

#### End-User Interview
I went to the AMNH and interviewed 4 groups of visitors who just finished their visit at AMNH and 2 NYU students who recently went to visit AMNH to know their thought, interests, experience and feeling about AMNH. It helps me get a better understanding of visitor’s current experience at AMNH.

### Define
#### Main Insights
- **AMNH’s impact among public is limited inside the museum:** AMNH can’t continue visitors’ experience and have no impact among visitors after the visit ends. Once visitors go back to their life, their connections with museum become weak, because they have no means to keep and augment their connections with AMNH.

- **Museum experience is an exploration process with friends and family:** The memory of exploring a museum with friends and family could last a long time if there is an exploration moment. It helps people build the special connection with friends, family and the exploration process itself. Sometimes it might inspire people’s passion and curiosity about the world.

- **Visitors expect interactive and immersive storytelling experience:** The current storytelling experience in AMNH is limited in text-heavy reading and static visualization which prohibit visitors from interacting with artifacts and enjoying the process of exploring the collections.

- **Visitors have extremely limited access to the physical pieces of collections:** Only 3% of over 34 millions pieces of the collections are on public display. And most of visitors think they wont’t be back to AMNH again because the collections in the exhibition hall hasn’t changed for a long time.

- **Visitors’ perception of the collections stay on the surface:** Although most people declare that the exhibitions is helpful for them to learn the human cultures, the natural world and the universe, they can hardly remember the information of the collections and they can’t even match the name of collections with them after the visit.

#### Ideation
During the speed date on class. I quickly test my pre-concept with 6 people based on the 5 main insights I have. I presented main three ideas to those people and I got feedback from them for each of my ideas. I polished one of those ideas. Then I moved forward and began trying to make prototype for this idea

It is about bringing the AMNH’s impact beyond the space, encouraging people to explore those unaccessible collections, making social sharing to rebuild their relationship with the collections and using the Central Park as a stage by holding an AR collected collections game. 

I made paper prototype and recruited 3 people to test this collection collected game idea.

From the prototype tests, I got a basic understanding of the affordances and possibility of AR. I have learn a lot of people’s needs from my research process, but I have little sense about the priority of the needs, which I could address reliably in my design. These test process helped me make design decisions and indicate me the direction where I want dive into further exploration through making a high fidelity prototype.

#### Design Decision
- Use AR technologhy as a way to create interactive, immersive and multiple-layer experience inside and outside the museum
- Release the greatest potential of undisplayed collections

#### Storyboard
Based on the feedback and design decision I have, I iterated my ideas and then I  draw a storyboard to show visitor’s new visit experience related to AMNH. The main stage of the new experience is exploring the undisplayed collections.

#### Technical exploration &prototype
I conduct research about AR technology and I made some simple AR prototype to explore the affordance of AR and how to attach multiple layers of information to 2D and 3D object. Its ability of mixing physical reality and digital world and potential of completely changing how people interact with  reality make me become a strong supporter. With the rapid development of AR technology in the mobile terminal in the past 3 years. This technology now has became less expensive and more accessible to being used in the daily life by people.

### Reflective
The whole project is quite fun for me. I have tried many research methods during the project such as observation, online survey, interview and a lot of secondary research in order to better know the problem space at AMNH. During the research process, the data from online survey help me quickly know the view of people. And I found that if you don’t recruit your interview subject before the interview, it will cause huge problem for you. It’s possible that you can’t find anyone who want to have an interview. In my case, I wasted several hours to wait at the exit in AMNH to ask people to have a short interview. And of course, I got refused by most of them. It is inefficient if you don’t recruit your interview subject. Also, I found it’s super helpful to have an expert interview. Because you can always receive the professional suggestions from the those experts. And they will come up with some different ideas and give you critics about your ideas from a totally different view, which can open your mind during the research stage. As a designer, learning from people is important. The process of pre-testing my design idea is super helpful to know how people react to my idea before you really began making low-fidelity prototype. They can keep pointing out the things you ignore in your pre-idea and might indicate you go to the potential direction. Hence, I thought the speed date process would be in my research method library forever.  In the ideation stage, I felt comfortable and smooth when I was making my paper prototype and conducting the Wizard of Oz method. This two method do help me explain my design idea and test those ideas to people. I thought the people are always crucial during the whole project. I learn from them to know their need and test them to receive feedback, then based on those I can keep iterating my design. Because my proposal for the problem at AMNH is to create an AR experience, I met my biggest difficult when I tried to make the technical prototype. When I began to make the technical prototype, I tried to use Unity, Vuforia and ARKit. However, those three tools are not that friendly for making quick prototype. Because they ask to write code and have a high study curve to use them. Although I used those three tools to make some simple test about detecting 2D & 3D object, it took me a long time to figure them out. Luckily, I found the Reality Composer, released by Apple in this September, was a friendly prototype tool for designer to prototype AR experience. It doesn’t ask for coding and have many default assets which can be used to make rapid prototype.

All the research methods and prototype methods I used are super helpful for me. It help me build a thought system and teach me the importance of testing that I never noticed before. I will keep all those in my mind in my future project.
