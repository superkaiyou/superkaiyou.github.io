### Research
#### Brief
This research of manufacturing sector explores the various phenomena associated with the decrease in manufacturing jobs in the United States and New York City, specifically. As one of the most consistently prominet election issues, our aim is to identify the stakeholders and complex causes bringing about upheaval in American manufacturing as well as the macro-, meso- and micro-scale effects that combine to alter the landscape of available jobs. By analyzing the systemic elements of the changing manufacturing sector, it highlight key insights and the language politicians use to frame the debate around this significat issue.
#### Outcome

#### Process of Depicting the System
![diagram made in class](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76687980-24ff5300-65ff-11ea-9216-3b37a2eccb89.png)

The project was started from brainstorming an issue of significant contemporary importance and posing a significant medium-long term challenge to New York City. We first came up with a pre-topic statement of "Unpaid/Low Wage Labor in New York City". Then we were tring to narrow down it into specific areas such as the effect of technology on the issue of unpaid or low-wage labor in New York City. The problem statement needed to reflect how technology has changed the landscape of this type of labor, who it is affecting, how and why. So a series of potential subtopics is came up with.

- Artificial Intelligence
- Gig Economy
- Unpaid Internships
- Creative Industries
- NYC Wage Laws
- Immigrant Exploitation
- Remote Work/Telecommuting
- Economic Inequality & Socioeconomic Status
- Prison Labor

Meanwhile, we reconceptulaize our question into"How has technology changed the availability of low wage/unpaid labo". Our research and evidence will bear out that

- Technology has changed the availability or access to labor, either positive or negative
- Who this situation is affecting
- What the results are
![mind meister diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76687836-106e8b00-65fe-11ea-8db4-1a289a3c3aff.png)

Then we were mianly researching how technology like job search platform that helps with the development of gig economy, which can leads a couple of social issues, for example, the lack of health insurance and benefits of individual workers.
![diagram1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76688009-59730f00-65ff-11ea-89d3-78f4d67337d9.jpg)

While we were trying to recreate a map that is more centered on our topic and our research, we found our that our statement aleady has both causes and consequences, which leads us to have a hard time to introduce different elements to the map. So we recenter our focus on "the decrease of manufacturing jobs in New York City". Taking into consideration the different dimensions and different scale, we created a quick sketch of different causes to the issue we are studying 

![diagram2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76688161-cf2baa80-6600-11ea-9e34-a96ed5950fc9.jpg)

In addition to switching to a polished topic, we decided to use Kumu to further expand and visualize the map.
![kumu1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76688210-2d588d80-6601-11ea-9e9e-aa0fdb57ca12.png)

Then we dedicated our time mostly on research, especially focusing on the three big factors that led to the decrease of manufacturing jobs, which are the Labor Export, Automation and Artificial Intelligence, and Media Portral. We found:

- Decades of trade agreement with the goal of global, open-market economy in conjunction with lower labor costs abroad and improved transportation technology has sent countless manufacturing jobs overseas.
- Modern,automated factories and foreign competition has led to an increse in high-skill jobs, lower wages for the fewer remaining low-skill jobs, and a need to close this education gap in the manufacturing workforce.
- Messaging around manufacturing is contradictory. With a decrease in available manufacturing job but low overall unemployment, manufacturing has only "increased" based on value as opposed to workforce strength.
![kumu2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76688369-71985d80-6602-11ea-996d-99c06956f916.png)

Then we also tried to look further into potential feedback loops. Some loops naturally cropped up in relation to various elements of the map, but we tried to focus on elements with strong positive or negative loops that tend to exacerbate the issue. One of the main elements found during this research was the skill gap for modern manufacturing positions. This phenomenon is in a feedback loop with micro and macro elements related to socioeconomic status. For instance, low socioeconomic status leads to less availability of educational support, due to public education being funded via property tax and unequal means. A lack of education means that people have worse economic mobility and less mastery of the technology needed to perhaps change their status to close the skill gap for the modern factory (learning how to do maintenance or manage machines in a factory, as opposed to literally building a product with your hands). The cost of education is prohibitive as well, especially when considering the lower wage expected for work that requires a higher education, compared to work in the past where the worker could be less educated and yet earned a higher wage. Worker injuries due to the physical reality of factory work, regardless of the modernization of factories, also exacerbate this feedback loop as people are unable to afford the treatment they need (to treat a back injury, for example), and then they are stuck in this loop of an inability to improve their lives through a combination of monetary constraints, limited educational opportunities, lack of healthcare, and lack of government support.

We plan on exploring this area of our complexity map, and the involved feedback loops, in more detail on our final gigamap.

We also flesh out micro-level elements. We have a lot of macro elements in our mess/causality map, so we needed to look closer at the social and behavioral elements affecting individuals on the micro scale. We did some more research regarding the personal considerations of people affected by the decrease in manufacturing. We found some interesting information regarding communities where factories have closed or jobs have offshored to China and other locations. In these communities there is an increase of “family breakdown,” less “marriageable” men, increased alcohol and drug use, more children born out of wedlock (a broader trend regardless, but statistically exacerbated in these communities), and born specifically within poverty to single parents.

we also tried to break out our technology considerations more than we previously had. Originally we had grouped a lot of the technological innovation in relation to factories together, as a universal element of “AI and automation replacing humans.” This was way too oversimplified, and so we tried to do more research and differentiate between automation and robots, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the development of information technology and communication, and the development of transportation and shipping technology. We need to do more work connecting these differentiated elements to causes and effects in relation to manufacturing (for instance, development of shipping technology with the use of data leads to a higher ability to offshore jobs due to a decreased cost of international decision-making).

Ultimately, We finalized the Kumu map as a great foundation for demonstrating the wickedness of our research statement (the decrease in manufacturing in New York City), with an almost overwhelming amount of arrows, causes and effects, and feedback loops.

![kumu final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76690031-af04e700-6612-11ea-948c-3b49ae25bd99.png)

However, within the map on kumu, the categorization of our related elements appears heavy in the economics sphere and lighter in ohter shperes which isn't an accurate representation of the actual distribution of categories. So we transfered it into Sketch to clean up the arrows to be more legible, making the hierarchy of scale clear, adn making the dimension categories easy to see. We were still using Kumu to emphasize the feedback loops within the system. But ends up at a hierachy complex map with stakeholders , which is easier to read 

![hierarchy map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76690102-571ab000-6613-11ea-93d7-9a777274c5bd.png)

Also we try to create the political frame for the manufacturing jobs, as manufacturing(and jobs in general) is consistent political issue in US, and especially interesting now, given that it is an election year. Through a Lakoffian metaphor map, we would be able to demonstrate the language frequently used by the two main strands of political thought in this country, as well as China’s perspective (as one of the main beneficiaries of offshoring and the global movement of manufacturing). The manner in which the debate is framed has a huge effect on the ways the parties are perceived and the causes they highlight within the complexity of the issue at large. Through the week, we scoured speeches and news sources that skew in one direction or another in terms of their political leanings in order to pull frequently used phrases or words in how conservatives and liberals frame the topic of manufacturing and jobs.

![political frame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76690265-d3fa5980-6614-11ea-80c9-92c114c3179a.png)

We decided to highlight was an elaboration of one of our key insights, the skill gap created in the manufacturing sector by the offshoring and lower wages of low-skill manufacturing jobs, and the creation of high-skill manufacturing jobs by virtue of increased automation and modern factories. These factors create a skill gap because there are jobs available, not being filled, by virtue of the lack of education of the normal demographic that would be filling manufacturing positions. We wanted to look at the micro-level considerations of this insight, looking at the effects on communities and individuals who are affected by factory and plant closures, including the cycle of poverty that a significant portion of people end up in, as one of the main distressing feedback loop effects.

![skill gap 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48978683/76690291-fa1ff980-6614-11ea-9d54-50513b4c49ed.png)

Then a gigamap depicting this complex, wicked problem of "status of american manufacturing" showed up. It emphasized key insights related to globalization, skill gap and media portral, focusing on elements from macro to micro and was albe to weave in a relevant narrative about political framing as well

### Design
#### Brief
Under the existing manufacturing situation in New York City. Our team takes from the leverage points of Donella Meadows and decides to design an experimental future, which shows a "high-tech" manufacturing world from different people's perspectives, to raise critical provocations and questions about issues that are of present importance and help visualize alternatives to present situations and think around what kinds of futures might be desirable or undesirable and to highlight actors, people, technologies, or institutions - that are and might be shaping the future in key ways.

#### Process of Depicting the Future
Our group wanted to focus on potential nodes of action surrounding the off-shoring of low-skill jobs, the creation of high-skill jobs, and the skill-gap and lack of required education to fill these jobs, which we found from the giga map. Taken from the leverage points of Donella Meadows and class notes, we aimed to find relevant interventions for these three nodes.

While these interventions are not direct solutions within the context of solving for a pandemic, we do feel that they will be relevant in the future regardless of these kinds of health circumstances. During this crisis, we have seen delays of shipping, both domestic and foreign, that put into sharp relief the need for consistent manufacturing output, delivery, and overall functioning of the global trading system of physical products. While part of our solution is looking at increasing the service economy in relation to classic manufacturing, there will never be a time when the country can go without these sorts of physical goods. In fact, in the future and post-crisis, it may seem more relevant than ever to maintain a domestic supply of manufacturing output instead of relying on international shipping, which could (we now see) be interrupted at any time. By increasing our system of green energy, green manufacturing, green technology, etc, we will be able to expand our ability to maintain high-quality products domestically, which secures our manufacturing sector by placing emphasis on the need for consistency in the face of a situation like COVID-19. By looking to the future, we can simultaneously increase high-skill and green jobs here while making sure that we are not fully dependent on foreign manufacturing.
##### Intervention Nodes
**Off-shoring of low-skill jobs/ Elimination of low-skill manufacturing jobs**
1. More local and community-based manufacturers focus on hiring from their local community
Intervention via #1 constants, parameters, numbers or #8 changing the rules of a system
By changing local business laws to incentivize local hiring (via tax breaks or other financial motives), the intervention centers around ‘changing the numbers’ for businesses to invest in their local communities (if X% of their workforce is hired locally, they get X% tax break)
2. Plastic ban and more regulation on the material of products
Intervention via #3 improving stock and flow infrastructures
With lower-cost sustainable materials, the incentive to use plastics and other non-sustainable materials in manufacturing will be decreased. With cheaper sustainable goods, there’s less incentive to be abroad for more relaxed material regulations.
3. Tying trade with foreign countries to human rights
Intervention via #1 constants, parameters, numbers
By making trade deals contingent on foreign factory conditions (at least more so than they currently are), the scales can be somewhat balanced in terms of saving some low-skill manufacturing jobs that are only “priced-out” by competition due to the lack of safety, pay, and human rights in some foreign factories. By quantifying some minimum safety requirements, the price difference in shifting factories abroad might not be so drastic, and therefore would lead to more jobs remaining in America.

**Creation of high-skill jobs**
1. Increase in desire for green technology
Intervention via #3 improving stock and flow infrastructures
By increasing cultural awareness of green technology and its potential in our society, the desire for sustainable products and a “green economy” increases, the demand for higher-tech manufacturing products (such as solar panels) increases, leading to higher demand for positions in this high-skill sector to be filled
2. Trading technology/services instead of labor
Intervention via #10 changing the goal of a system
By changing the goal from maintaining low-skill manufacturing jobs to continuing the increase of service jobs, and their availability to previously low-skill manufacturing workers, this allows for the expansion of the service economy instead of trying to hold on to the past.
3. Increasing awareness of the skill gap
Intervention via #7 Making sure that information given to all the actors in a system is accurate, relevant, accessible, and conveyed through the right channels – people in a system change their behavior based on the information they have
By combating the notion that “manufacturing is dead” or that these types of jobs don’t exist anymore, having a stronger media presence of the increase in high-skill manufacturing jobs, and the resulting skill-gap and availability of these jobs, would provide the information necessary for people to make better decisions in regard to educating themselves to occupy these positions

**Lack of post-secondary or polytechnic education**
1. Community-based polytechnic education programs subsidized by public funding
Intervention via #10 changing the paradigm underlying the goal of a system
The goal of increased polytechnic education is hampered by the lack of access to said education through funding. By allowing more government intervention in funding these programs, this changes the paradigm underlying the ability to access this kind of education.
2. Job training: 3 - 6 months of paid training sessions
Intervention via #2 increasing the buffer size of a system
By allowing workers to be trained in a paid system of preparation, it increases the buffer for these workers in terms of being able to live their lives, save money, continue supporting families, etc.
3. Providing access to technology
Intervention via #6 Driving or empowering negative feedback loops and suppressing or regulating positive feedback loops
By providing grants to low-income people who have lost their low-skill manufacturing jobs, but who do not have the technological know-how or access to online educational efforts to retrain, it could interrupt this negative feedback loop of lack of access to technology/the modern factory jobs that are available.

Then we considered about those three potential nodes and used Voros’ version of the futures cone to come up with scenarios for possible future for a node.

Then we also try to brainstorm our final deliver by using Stuart Candy's future Ladder.
