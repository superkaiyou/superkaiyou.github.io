<h1> Drawnote </h1>
<p> The dematerialisation of the modern music producing process has led to an revolution of making music. This project is going to discover the social  potential of free drawing the digital notes which creates an emotional identity message for the drawer and the intersection of visualtion and auditory. </p>
<p>Drawnote is a digital drawing board. Users will draw any figures to represent their own identity at that moment. Once the drawing is done, the code then translates the figures into a musical sequence using 3 types of instruments.</p>
<p>The musical sequence can be remixed mutilple times, which will create a unique piece. The musical sequence translated from the drawing will be shared on the users' social media. It offer a chance to experience the process of music making in a playful and creative way. </p>
