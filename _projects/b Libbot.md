### Problem Statement

I have been used to borrowing books from public libraries in my hometown since I was a kid. However, I am frustrated that everytime I need to be back and forth between different libraries to borrow the book I want. It wastes time and sometimes make me annoyed. Therefore, I began to ask the question:

>##### How might we create a borrowing experience for public library users to to check the availabilty of books and borrow books easily?

### Design Outcome

### Understand


#### Public Library Web Heuristic Evaluation
Public library in my hometown have its web-based system for users to use the library resources. So I do a Heuristic Evaluation for the website to know the problems.

#### Interview & Contextual Observation

In order to explore the problem space and study for specific pain points from my users. I observe  people coming to public libraries. Then I interviewed 6 of them to know about their own diverse experiences. Based on those probing, I specifically identified types of users.

Then I visualize the data I observed and document the **children’s path** and their key points when they interact with the library context.

### Persona

###  User Journey Map

## Design Process

I observed many children in the library **got lost** while they were trying to find books. There are too much steps that they could be confused about. They **kept asking for help** from librarian and tried to understand the reference number, then matched these numbers and books

Under this situation, I was thinking about how to simplify the whole process.  And before that, I need to figure out these questions：

### Why they got lost easily

### What were their attitudes to the survey and guestbook

By interviewing my users, I found that they were got lost because of their **body size** and **lacking direction-sense.** Not like a high enough adult with wild view, they could’t see all signs clearly. And they did’t understand the whole system in the library. It’s hard for them to **hack the meaning of reference number.** Meanwhile, it was obvious that survey and guestbooks were outdated and boring, they wanted more interesting ways to tell their feeling. 

### How to simplify the whole process
Based on the user needs above, I conducted brainstorm and came up with my ideas.

Brainstorming opened my way of thinking about the solutions. And some of them did give me the potential design direction. Based on the direction, I was considering: 

>Can I use AR to make the finding process more smoothly and explore the space of using emoji to help children share their feeling

### Storyboard

After I decided my design direction, I began to sketch my idea. Trying to make the searching process simple and intuitive to children, I added voice search and image search function and highlight them. Also, to get rid of text-heavy survey, the emoji and animoji were used to make sure children feel interesting when they told their experience.

### Sketching

Then I draw an information architecture diagram to help me **organize the user flow.** And then I decided three main functions: search , survey and basic book info.

Then I carried out my design iterations and polished my design.

### Iteration

### Evaluation

I did’t conduct a fully usability testing because of limited time. However, I interviewed two of my cousins who try out my prototype and they gave me some positive reaction. The searching process became much more simple and efficient, the image search and voice search are preferred by them. The AR concept could helped  keep them in the right direction and find the books much more quickly. The emoji and animoji function feels fun and interesting, they were glad to use it to share their feelings and give feedback to librarian, and think it’s a really cool thing. It really help them avoid text-heavy survey process and arouse more interest to give their suggestions.

### Design Polished

In the search view, the voice search and image search are what I encourage children to use. I originally make the mic icon and camera icon gray. However, my cousin, one of the participant, told me that he habitually used text to search and easily overlooked both voice search and image search functions. So I decided to highlight these two icons to encourage children to use them.

In the book information view, participant said it’s hard to read under the left layout. So I redesign the layout and make it more readable.

In the book borrowed information view, I originally use big size text to emphasize the date of expiry and arrange the information layout naturally to me. ( I was wrong ) According to my cousins’ reaction, I redesign the layout and use different text sizes and text color to differentiate title and borrowed date. Then I used consistent color to highlight the date of expiry instead of big size text, which makes it easily accessible and more noticeably to children. 

## Reflection

the most meaningful thing I learned from the design process is the importance of considering **context and users.** Under same context, different type of users will have different needs. And under different context, same users will have different needs.
