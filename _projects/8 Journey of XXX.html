<!-- <p>Drawnote is a digital drawing board. Users will draw any figures to represent their own identity at that moment. Once the drawing is done, the code then translates the figures into a musical sequence using 3 types of instruments.</p> -->
<!-- <p class="pb-500">The musical sequence can be remixed multiple times, which will create a unique piece. The musical sequence translated from the drawing will be shared on the users' social media. It offers a chance to experience the process of music-making playfully and creatively. </p> -->
