# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Having a mixing background of ecological engineering and digital media, I am now pursuing my graduate degree in Integrated Digital Media at New York University. I love design just like I love imagining the unknown future. In my mind, the future world will be created by the adventurer with creation, cyber-tech, and empathy. I am running on the road to this cyber world.
